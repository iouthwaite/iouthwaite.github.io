<ins>1. Maximizing Selectivity with Inhibitor Combinations</ins>

Although drug combinations are a mainstay of modern oncology, toxicity remains a major challenge to introducing new combinations therapies. We explore the idea of using combinations of different compounds that all share a common target, but have different off-target effects. By developing a method to precisely adjust how much of each compound we want to use, we can reduce the off-targets effects of any single compound.   

Key finding: we can greatly improve selectivity for therapeutic co-targets using inhibitor combinations

<ins>2. Targeting MET in human cancers</ins>

Ian R Outhwaite; Markus A Seeliger (and others)

Mutations in mesenchymal epithelial transition factor (c-MET/MET) protein kinase drives many human cancers. Additionally, MET signaling can act as a backdoor that helps tumors overcome drugs targeting other common oncogenes. In this ongoing work we are defining which drugs to use to target specific MET mutations, either as solo targets or in combination with other common targets in human cancers.
