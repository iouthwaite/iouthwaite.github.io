**Cancer is a moving target**

Resistance can develop to even the most targeted medicines, necessitating new strategies to overcome whatever cancer can throw at us. I’m a 6th year MD/PhD student in the 4th year of my PhD training, grateful for the opportunity to generate solutions to these critical problems. My work falls into the following areas:

**1 – Evaluating drug combination synergy** 
	
I study how best to pick drugs to selectively inhibit multiple co-targets, optimize synergy between orthosteric and allosteric drugs at the same target, and assess bitopic (linked) compounds. 

**2 – Structural and biophysical understandings of compound selectivity and resistance**

I use structural techniques (crystallography, cryo-EM) to visualize how antibody F’abs and small molecule compounds interact with proteins. I also study the kinetics of protein-drug interactions using purified proteins as well as in-cell approaches, with a particular emphasis on dissociation processes that are correlated with drug efficacy.
