**Cancer is a moving target**

<img src="assets/1000_cuts_picture_updated.png" width="600">

Resistance can develop to even the most targeted medicines, necessitating new strategies and solutions. I’m a 6th year MD/PhD student in the 4th year of my PhD training, grateful for the opportunity to work on these critical problems. My science falls into the following areas:

**1 – Evaluating drug combination synergy** 
	
I study how best to pick drugs to selectively inhibit multiple co-targets, optimize synergy between orthosteric and allosteric drugs at the same target, and assess bitopic (linked) compounds. 

**2 – Understandings of compound selectivity and resistance**

I use structural, biochemical and biophysical technqiues to understand how drugs interact with proteins. I also study kinetics of protein-drug interactions with a particular emphasis on dissociation processes that are correlated with drug efficacy.
