     	  I work/have worked with expert teams from Stony Brook (Bahar, Tsirka, Miller), MSKCC (Chodera, Long), SGC Frankfurt (Knapp), UMD (Tiwary), and UCSF (Shah, Shokat) among others. My incredible PhD mentor, Dr. Markus Seeliger, has shown me what collaborative science can generate. I've developed skills at the interface of biochemistry and computational biology and I speak both languages. Send me a line if you would like to collaborate. <br><br>
