     	  My PhD mentor, Dr. Markus Seeliger, has given me the opportunity to work with some [terrific groups](./Projects) and has shown me what collaborative science can generate. I've developed skills at the interface of biochemistry and computational biology and I speak both languages. Send me a line if you would like to talk science. <br><br>
